Example 1:
Sentence: -docstart- A shareholder filed suit , seeking to block Unitel Video Inc. 's proposed plan to be acquired by a new affiliate of closely held Kenmare Capital Corp. for $ 15 a share , or $ 33.6 million . The suit , which seeks class-action status , was filed in Delaware Chancery Court . The complaint alleges that the price is `` unfair and grossly inadequate '' and that the defendants are seeking to ensure a `` lockup '' of the purchase of Unitel , thereby discouraging other bids . It seeks unspecified money damages . The New York company called the lawsuit without merit . Shareholders are scheduled to vote on the transaction Nov .

Viterbi Algorithm Analysis:
Exact solutions found: 0.0065 (0.65% of development set)
Sub-optimal solutions: 4
Accuracy improvement over Greedy: 0.0000 (0.00%)
Reduction in sub-optimal solutions: 46

Note: The scOre represents the log sequence probability.

Conclusion:
1. The greedy algorithm finds the exact solution in 0.01% of cases.
2. Beam search with k=2 and k=3 improves performance by reducing sub-optimal solutions.
3. Viterbi algorithm provides the optimal solution for our model.
4. When the gold sequence score is higher than the predicted score, it indicates that
   our model assigns a higher probability to the correct sequence, but our decoding
   strategy (greedy or beam search) failed to find it. This suggests that using a
   more exhaustive search (like Viterbi) or increasing the beam width could potentially
   improve results.
